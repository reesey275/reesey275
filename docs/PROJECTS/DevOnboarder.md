DevOnboarder

Problem. Onboarding and debugging burn time; fixes and context live in people’s heads.
Approach. Capture trials/errors → AARs → doctrine; wire that into CI and docs so the system teaches the next person.
Your role. Architecture, CI pipelines, docs structure, agent guidance.
Stack. GitHub, CI scripts, markdown/AAR templates, agent playbooks.
Outcomes. Fewer repeated bugs, faster ramp-up, growing set of guardrails tied to real incidents.
Next. Expand AAR coverage, surface “repeat offenders” as badges in PRs, publish anonymized examples.
