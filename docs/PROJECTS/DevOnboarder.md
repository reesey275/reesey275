DevOnboarder

Problem
Service onboarding across the platform is inconsistent and wastes time recreating context.

Approach
Centralize multi-service onboarding in a control plane that coordinates Discord intake,
hybrid Bash/Python automation, and guardrails that uphold a 95% quality bar.

Your role
program management, automation architecture, Discord integrations, and documentation.

Outcomes
faster contributor ramp-up, measurable quality thresholds, and fewer repeated onboarding blockers.

Next steps
finish the hybrid runner migration, expand AAR coverage, and tune automation guardrails
from real Discord and service feedback.
