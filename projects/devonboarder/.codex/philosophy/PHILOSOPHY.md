# DevOnboarder Philosophy

DevOnboarder treats onboarding as a first-class, multi-service program. We favor automation that keeps Discord-first intake, documentation, and service runbooks in sync while enforcing a 95% quality threshold. Tooling should remain hybrid—shell scripts stay available for legacy teams while Python services absorb new automation. Every experiment should capture after action reports (AARs) so guardrails tighten instead of drifting.
