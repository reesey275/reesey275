# DevonBoarder Philosophy

DevonBoarder is a lightweight experiment in web mapping. It emphasizes open data and portable tooling. Prototypes should rely on public datasets like OpenStreetMap and remain easy to host in small containers. Development favors quick iterations documented in Markdown and avoids vendor lock-in or unnecessary dependencies.
