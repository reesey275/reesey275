# DevonBoarder Project

DevonBoarder is a personal experiment exploring web mapping tools for the Devon coastline. The goal is to build an interface that aggregates walking routes, local attractions, and surf spots using data from OpenStreetMap. The project is still in the planning stage while I evaluate frameworks and sketch out the architecture. Next steps include prototyping a front‑end with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and publishing the initial code.
