# Tags Auth Server Philosophy

This project explores tag-based authorization as an alternative to rigid roles. Access policies should be easy to adjust by changing labels. The core server stays lightweight and is intended to run in Docker containers. Integration with OAuth 2.0 is planned, but simplicity and clear documentation take priority over extensive features.
