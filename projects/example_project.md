# Example Project

This page demonstrates the preferred format for describing new projects. It holds generic content so I can verify the automation workflow that builds the portfolio. Feel free to use it as a template when adding real projects. For Markdown tips, see [GitHub's guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). No active development is planned for this placeholder.
