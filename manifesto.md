# Project Manifesto

This repository reflects an automation-first mindset. The following principles guide all work:

- Document decisions in Markdown.
- Commit small, iterative changes.
- Prefer open tooling and transparent processes.
- Share knowledge to empower others.
- Let automation handle repetitive tasks whenever possible.
