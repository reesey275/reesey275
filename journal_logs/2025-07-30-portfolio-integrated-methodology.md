# 2025-07-30 Portfolio Integrated Methodology

Today I mapped out the plan to integrate all portfolio projects under a single automated workflow. The key steps are:

1. Consolidate project documentation so the Codex agents can generate consistent READMEs across the repository.
2. Use `agent_profile_writer` to sync summaries for each project into the main portfolio page.
3. Schedule the deployment agent to publish updates to GitHub Pages after every successful merge.
4. Capture lessons learned in additional journal logs to maintain a trail of decisions.

This approach ensures the portfolio stays current while reducing manual upkeep.
