Philosophy

We learn by doing, document the struggle, and turn it into doctrine—then we automate it.

Visible learning. Log trials, errors, and decisions where others can follow the path.

Doctrine. Compress experience into clear rules, playbooks, and templates.

Automation. Encode doctrine into CI, scripts, and agents so quality scales.
