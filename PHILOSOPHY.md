# Integration Philosophy

This repository is built around four guiding pillars that shape how automation and collaboration occur.

## Philosophy-Driven Development
Acknowledge the intent behind every change. Document reasoning in Markdown so the project's values remain clear and easy to share.

## Vibe-Coding with Recovery
Work in small, iterative bursts while capturing context. If something goes wrong, rollback is simple because progress is tracked in commits and Markdown.

## Codex Agent Scaffolding for Ethical Automation
Use Codex agents to handle repetitive tasks, but keep configuration transparent in `.codex/`. Automation should never obscure how decisions are made.

## Cognitive Fault-Tolerant Engineering
Design workflows to withstand mistakes and unexpected inputs. Favor lightweight tooling that can self-correct and continue running even when partial failures occur.
