# PROFILE_LOCK_2025-12 — Reesey275

Effective: 2025-12-20
Scope: README.md (profile)

This profile README is locked as the December 2025 baseline. It reflects a confident first-person voice, structured project blurbs (Overview · Stack · Role · Highlights), harmonized terminology, and minimalist polish.

Future changes should be deliberate and evidence-backed. Update only if:
- Role/responsibilities materially change
- A new flagship project ships or the ecosystem architecture evolves meaningfully
- A security-critical correction or terminology harmonization is required

Unlock procedure:
1. Open a GitHub issue in `reesey275` titled: "Profile Unlock Request — YYYY-MM"
2. Summarize proposed changes and rationale
3. Link related commits, artifacts, or governance issues (e.g., TAGS-META standards)
4. Apply changes via a single, well-structured commit message (DOCS(profile): ...)

Optional archival:
- Canvas snapshot or GitHub Issue linkback can be created for historical traceability upon request.
