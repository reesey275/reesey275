## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

"Structure over improvisation • Accountability over ambiguity • Correctness over cleverness"

I build systems the way mission-critical operations demand they be built. If a system requires tribal knowledge to function, it is already a liability. My approach emphasizes observable, repeatable, resilient systems with clear standards, direct feedback, and auditability.

**Availability**: Open to opportunities • Veteran-owned • Florida-based

> _"We practice in public so others can perform in peace."_
