# Reesey275 Profile README — December 2025 Change Log

Date: 2025-12-20
Repository: reesey275
Branch: main

## Summary
This change set brings the profile README to a confident, technically-accurate, and terminologically consistent state. It unifies the voice to first-person, structures project blurbs for clarity, and applies minimal polish while preserving a clean aesthetic.

## Changes
- Terminology harmonization:
  - Standardize TAGS (The Angry Gamer Show Productions) references
  - Clarify NSLS once, confidently (National Society of Leadership and Success)
  - Use "Shell (POSIX/Bash)" consistently across sections
- Education & Certifications:
  - Create dedicated section and frame WGU degree complementarily
  - Include NSLS honor
- Project blurbs:
  - Normalize into tight one-liners (purpose → delivery format → scale/focus)
- Voice unification:
  - First-person voice across header and project sections
- Featured Projects structure:
  - Adopt Overview · Stack · Role · Highlights pattern
- Minimalist polish:
  - Add discrete badges (Python, POSIX/Bash, TypeScript, Docker, GitHub Actions)
  - Optional subtle header ("Mr. Potato")

## Rationale
- Confidence-first tone, evidence-based governance, and clean presentation
- Explicit ownership (architect/lead) and clear scope without fluff
- Harmonized labels to eliminate ambiguity and prevent drift

## References
- Organization: The Angry Gamer Show Productions — https://github.com/theangrygamershowproductions
- Governance context: TAGS-META issue #369 (Actions allowlist & SHA pinning) — for ecosystem standards

## Maintenance Guidance
- Only update when there is:
  1) A material change to role, responsibilities, or ecosystem scope
  2) A new flagship project or architectural milestone
  3) A security-critical correction or terminology fix
- Prefer small, surgical edits that preserve structure and tone.
