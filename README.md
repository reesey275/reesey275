## 🥔 Chad Reesey — Mr. Potato

## 🚀 About Me
- **25+ years** building and securing systems across civilian and government environments
- Veteran | Systems-first builder | DevOps & governance automation specialist
- I build thinking systems: **visible learning → doctrine → automation**
- Currently leading TAGS (The Angry Gamer Show Productions) Ecosystem
- Recent: Oct 10, 2025 — integrated DevOnboarder as TAGS foundation with IaaS/PaaS/SaaS architecture and 95% quality guardrails
- **U.S. Air Force veteran** — mission-focused operations, accountability, and system reliability shaped by service in mission-critical environments

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy
I build systems the way mission-critical operations demand they be built:
- Structure over improvisation
- Accountability over ambiguity
- Correctness over cleverness
- Documentation over assumptions
- Automation over heroics

If a system requires tribal knowledge to function, it is already a liability.

## 🔧 How I Work
- Written context before decisions; initial meetings are used for scoping and discovery when requirements are still forming
- Bias toward observable, repeatable, resilient systems
- Deterministic CI, linting, documentation validation, and reproducible builds
- Clear standards, direct feedback, and auditability over hand-waving

## 📊 GitHub Stats

**Primary Languages:** Python • Shell (POSIX/Bash) • JavaScript • TypeScript • PowerShell  
**Public Repositories:** 3 active projects • 3 private development repos  
**Organization:** [The Angry Gamer Show Productions](https://github.com/theangrygamershowproductions) — 9 repositories

### GitHub Contribution Activity

Note: Contribution activity reflects a solo build phase focused on end-to-end system design and execution.
