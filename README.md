I build thinking systems: visible learning → doctrine → automation.
This is my living portfolio—flagship projects, engineering philosophy, and a public learning trail.

DevOnboarder — turn failures into guardrails; journals → doctrine; CI that teaches.
→ docs/PROJECTS/DevOnboarder.md

core-instructions — governance & agent contracts/doctrine that align people and automations.
→ docs/PROJECTS/core-instructions.md

SquirrelFocus — fast journaling/knowledge-capture CLI that lowers friction to log insights.
→ docs/PROJECTS/SquirrelFocus.md

We practice in public so others can perform in peace.
