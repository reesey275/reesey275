# Chad Reesey | reesey275

> Veteran software engineer and systems architect building secure, self-hosted tools and AI-integrated platforms. NSLS-inducted leader, founder of TAGS.

## 🚀 About Me
- Veteran | Systems-first builder | DevOps & governance automation
- I build thinking systems: **visible learning → doctrine → automation**
- 25+ years across civilian and government environments; currently leading TAGS Ecosystem and completing B.S. CS @ WGU (2024–2027)
- Recent: Oct 10, 2025 — integrated DevOnboarder as TAGS foundation with IaaS/PaaS/SaaS architecture and 95% quality guardrails
- **U.S. Air Force veteran** — mission-focused operations, accountability, and system reliability shaped by service in mission-critical environments

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy
I build systems the way mission-critical operations demand they be built:
- Structure over improvisation
- Accountability over ambiguity
- Correctness over cleverness
- Documentation over assumptions
- Automation over heroics

If a system requires tribal knowledge to function, it is already a liability.

## 🔧 How I Work
- Written context before decisions; initial meetings are used for scoping and discovery when requirements are still forming
- Bias toward observable, repeatable, resilient systems
- Deterministic CI, linting, documentation validation, and reproducible builds
- Clear standards, direct feedback, and auditability over hand-waving
