Welcome to my Codex-driven portfolio. Everything here is real, modular, and battle-tested.

Read the [integration philosophy](PHILOSOPHY.md) for the guiding principles.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **[DevonBoarder](projects/devonboarder/)** – Mapping experiments for the Devon coastline
- **[TAGS Auth Server](projects/tags_auth_server/)** – Discord OAuth2 + Role-based Access
- **[Ghostscript UI](projects/ghostscript_ui/)** – PDF/PostScript conversion with Web UI
- **[Education Tools](projects/education_tools/)** – Algebra generators and learning platforms

## 📊 Engineering Impact & Project Outcomes

For a quick overview of key metrics, see the [Engineering Metrics Summary](codex_metrics_summary.md).

### 🚀 DevonBoarder (in progress)
- Exploring web mapping tools for the Devon coastline.
- Aggregates walking routes, local attractions, and surf spots using OpenStreetMap data.
- Currently prototyping a front-end with **Leaflet** while sketching the architecture.
- **Outcome:** Early-stage experiment focused on planning and data integration.

### 📘 Core Instructions (Governance OS for Codex Agents)
- Authored **structured, CI-enforced documentation** for all C-Suite roles across two orgs (TAGS & CRFV), including:
  - `charter.md`, `checklist.md`, and `agent.md` per role.
- Created a **7-workflow GitHub Actions CI system** enforcing:
  - 95%+ coverage, metadata validation, PR-only changes, and full markdownlint/Vale compliance.
- Designed for agent lifecycle management, permission mapping, and secure governance across Codex-controlled infrastructure.
- **Outcome:** Built a CI-secured, fully auditable governance framework deployable across any automation-driven org.

### 🧠 Codex Agent Ecosystem & Philosophy
- Deployed 12+ Codex agents as modular infrastructure across systems, each bound to specific roles (e.g. CTO, CI Guard, Doc Validator).
- Built a **routing and metadata enforcement model** enabling Codex agents to self-audit, escalate, and follow runtime observability rules.
- Designed a philosophy of **"Ethical Automation"** and **"Codex-as-OS"**, replacing fragile human-in-loop processes with agent-first design.
- **Outcome:** Delivered the velocity of an 8-person team with ~5 weeks of solo execution and full reproducibility.

### 🗂️ ReC275 Profile (Codex-Powered Portfolio)
- Created a **self-maintaining GitHub portfolio** with integrated Codex agents for:
  - Automatic resume updates  
  - Project summaries  
  - Deployment sync via GitHub Actions
- Live `README.md` content is managed by AI and updates with project metadata automatically.
- **Outcome:** Developer branding and project tracking system that requires zero manual maintenance post-deploy.

## 🎓 Credentials & Resume
- **[Resume (PDF)](resume/resume.pdf)**

## 🤖 Codex-Powered
This profile updates itself. Codex Agents handle:
- Project summaries
- Resume sync
- Pages deployment
- Manual notes via [`record_knowledge_dump.sh`](record_knowledge_dump.sh) \
  (use [`codex/tasks/knowledge_dump_TEMPLATE.md`](codex/tasks/knowledge_dump_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point)

## ✅ Summary & Testing Notes

This repository currently reflects the initial Codex-driven portfolio template.
Automation scripts manage content updates, but no automated test suite exists yet.
Manual checks are performed before committing changes to ensure files render correctly. The portfolio integration plan is documented in [journal_logs/2025-07-30-portfolio-integrated-methodology.md](journal_logs/2025-07-30-portfolio-integrated-methodology.md).

### 🧠 Operational Philosophy: Codex as Second Brain

Codex acts as a persistent automation layer for this repository. Treat it as your
second brain: capture decisions in Markdown, commit small updates frequently and
let the agents keep documentation and workflow files in sync. The goal is to
spend less time on rote maintenance and more on building.

### What Needs to Happen Now

- Review the current scaffold for accuracy and update any placeholder info.
- Populate each project page in `projects/*/README.md` with real descriptions and links.
- Configure required secrets (`CI_PROFILE_PUSH_TOKEN`, `CODEX_AGENT_AUTH`) if
  you plan to run agents automatically.
- Enable GitHub Pages once the repo is public and confirm the workflow deploys.
- Keep all Codex-related instructions under `.codex/` versioned with the repo.

### Knowledge Transfer & Onboarding

For collaborators:
- Review `.github/workflows` to see how Codex agents run.
- Check [docs/AGENT_INDEX.md](docs/AGENT_INDEX.md) for each agent's role and configuration.
- Document any manual setup steps or secrets required.
- Capture decisions in Markdown so automation has context.
