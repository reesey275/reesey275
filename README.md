## 🤖 Codex-Powered
This profile updates itself. Codex Agents handle:
- Project summaries
- Resume sync
- Pages deployment
- Manual notes via [`record_knowledge_dump.sh`](record_knowledge_dump.sh) \
  (use [`codex/tasks/knowledge_dump_TEMPLATE.md`](codex/tasks/knowledge_dump_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point)

## ✅ Summary & Testing Notes

This repository currently reflects the initial Codex-driven portfolio template.
Automation scripts manage content updates, but no automated test suite exists yet.
Manual checks are performed before committing changes to ensure files render correctly.

### 🧠 Operational Philosophy: Codex as Second Brain

Codex acts as a persistent automation layer for this repository. Treat it as your
second brain: capture decisions in Markdown, commit small updates frequently and
let the agents keep documentation and workflow files in sync. The goal is to
spend less time on rote maintenance and more on building.

### What Needs to Happen Now

- Review the current scaffold for accuracy and update any placeholder info.
- Populate each project page in `projects/*/README.md` with real descriptions and links.
- Configure required secrets (`CI_PROFILE_PUSH_TOKEN`, `CODEX_AGENT_AUTH`) if
  you plan to run agents automatically.
- Enable GitHub Pages once the repo is public and confirm the workflow deploys.
- Keep all Codex-related instructions under `.codex/` versioned with the repo.

### Knowledge Transfer & Onboarding
